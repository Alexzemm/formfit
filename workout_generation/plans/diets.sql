--    Activity Level: Lightly Active
--    Estimated Basal Calories: 2588 calories
--    Dietary Preference: Vegetarian
--    Allergies/Intolerances: None
--    Medical conditions: None
-- 
-- Understanding the Goal:
-- For muscle gain, Alex needs to be in a caloric surplus while consuming adequate protein for muscle repair and growth, and sufficient carbohydrates for energy and recovery. Given his current weight (60kg) for his height (180cm), Alex is quite lean, so a consistent surplus is crucial for healthy weight and muscle gain.
-- 
-- Adjusted Calorie Target for Muscle Gain:
-- To achieve a healthy muscle gain rate (approx. 0.25-0.5kg/week), we'll add a surplus of 300 calories to his estimated daily needs.
--    Target Daily Calories: 2588 (baseline) + 300 (surplus) = 2888 calories (Let's round to ~2900 calories for practical planning).

--            28% of 2900 kcal = 812 kcal.
--            (812 kcal / 9 kcal/g = ~90 grams of fat). Let's aim for 85-95 grams of fat.
--        Carbohydrates: Remaining calories (for energy, performance, and recovery).
--            2900 kcal - 480 kcal (protein) - 812 kcal (fat) = 1608 kcal

-- ---
-- 
-- 4. Meal Prep Tips
-- 
--    Batch Cook Grains: Cook a large batch of brown rice, quinoa, or lentils at the beginning of the week. Store in airtight containers for quick meals.
--    Chop Vegetables: Pre-chop veggies for stir-fries, curries, and salads.
--    Pre-portioned Snacks: Divide nuts, seeds, and fruit into individual baggies or containers.
--    Hard-Boiled Eggs: Boil a dozen eggs at once for easy protein snacks.
--    Protein Sources: Cook a larger batch of tofu scramble, roasted chickpeas, or lentil curry that can be used for multiple meals.
--    Smoothie Packs: Measure out dry smoothie ingredients (protein powder, oats, seeds) into bags; just add milk and fresh fruit when blending.
--    Utilize Leftovers: Plan meals that produce healthy leftovers for lunches or dinners on busy days.
-- 
-- ---
-- 
-- 5. Hydration Recommendations
-- 
--    Water is Key: Aim for 3-4 liters of water per day. This is especially important for muscle function, nutrient transport, and overall health, especially when consuming higher calories and protein.
--    Carry a Water Bottle: Keep a reusable water bottle with you to encourage consistent sips throughout the day.
--    Hydrate Around Workouts: Drink water before, during, and after any physical activity.
--    Limit Sugary Drinks: Avoid sodas, sweetened juices, and excessive consumption of energy drinks, as they add empty calories and can hinder progress.
--    Include Herbal Teas: Unsweetened herbal teas can contribute to your daily fluid intake.
-- 
-- ---
-- 
-- 6. Supplement Recommendations (Optional, but beneficial for muscle gain)
-- 
-- Given Alex's vegetarian diet and muscle gain goal, certain supplements can be highly beneficial:
-- 
-- 1.  Vegetarian Protein Powder:
--        Recommendation: Whey protein (if dairy-friendly), Soy protein, or a plant-based blend (pea, rice, hemp).
--        Why: Convenient way to meet high protein targets, especially around workouts or as a quick snack.
--        Dosage: 1-2 scoops (20-40g protein) daily, mixed with water or milk.
-- 
-- 2.  Creatine Monohydrate:
--        Recommendation: Pure Creatine Monohydrate.
--        Why: One of the most researched and effective supplements for increasing strength, power, and muscle mass.
--        Dosage: 3-5g per day, consistently, regardless of workout days. Can be mixed with water, juice, or your protein shake.
-- 
-- 3.  Multivitamin/Mineral:
--        Recommendation: A high-quality multivitamin specifically formulated for men or athletes.
--        Why: Acts as an insurance policy to cover any potential micronutrient gaps that might occur, especially on a vegetarian diet (e.g., B12, Iron, Zinc, Vitamin D).
--        Dosage: As per product label, usually one capsule daily.
-- 
-- 4.  Vitamin B12:
--        Recommendation: Standalone B12 supplement (Methylcobalamin form).
--        Why: B12 is almost exclusively found in animal products. While some fortified foods contain it, a dedicated supplement is crucial for vegetarians to prevent deficiency, which can impact energy levels and nerve function.
--        Dosage: 1000-2500 mcg weekly, or 25-100 mcg daily (consult a healthcare professional).
-- 
-- 5.  Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Algal Oil):
--        Recommendation: Algal Oil (plant-based source of DHA and EPA).
--        Why: Important for heart health, brain function, and reducing inflammation. While flax seeds and chia seeds provide ALA (which the body converts to EPA/DHA inefficient efficiently), algal oil provides direct EPA/DHA for vegetarians.
--        Dosage: As per product label, typically 250-500mg combined EPA/DHA daily.
-- 
-- Always consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before starting any new supplement regimen.
-- 
-- ---
-- 
-- 7. Foods to Avoid and Prioritize
-- 
-- Foods to Prioritize (for Muscle Gain & Vegetarian Diet):
-- 
--    High-Quality Protein Sources:
--        Dairy: Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, paneer, milk.
--        Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans, edamame.
--        Soy Products: Tofu, tempeh, fortified soy milk.
--        Eggs: Whole eggs (if ovo-vegetarian).
--        Grains: Quinoa (complete protein), oats, whole-wheat pasta/bread.
--        Nuts & Seeds: Almonds, walnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds.
--        Seitan (wheat gluten, very high protein).
--    Complex Carbohydrates:
--        Whole grains: Brown rice, oats, quinoa, whole-wheat bread/pasta, barley, farro.
--        Starchy vegetables: Sweet potatoes, potatoes, corn, peas.
--        Fruits: Bananas, berries, apples, oranges.
--    Healthy Fats:
--        Avocado, nuts, seeds, nut butters, olive oil, coconut oil.
--    Fiber-Rich Fruits & Vegetables:
--        All types of fruits and vegetables to ensure micronutrient intake and digestive health. Focus on a wide variety of colors.
-- 
-- Foods to Limit or Avoid:
-- 
--    Highly Processed Foods: Packaged snacks, fast food, frozen meals high in sodium and unhealthy fats. These often lack nutrients and contain empty calories.
--    Excessive Added Sugars: Sugary drinks (sodas, sweetened juices), candies, pastries, desserts. These lead to energy crashes and contribute to fat gain rather than muscle.
--    Trans Fats & Excessive Saturated Fats: Found in deep-fried foods, some baked goods, and highly processed snacks. Opt for healthy unsaturated fats instead.
--    Refined Grains: White bread, white pasta, white rice in excess. While they can provide quick energy, they lack the fiber and nutrients of whole grains.
--    Alcohol: Limit alcohol intake as it can impair muscle recovery, hormone balance, and add empty calories.
-- 
-- ---
-- 
-- Important Considerations:
-- 
--    Listen to Your Body: This plan is a guideline. Adjust portion sizes based on your hunger, satiety, energy levels, and how your body responds.
--    Consistency is Key: Adhering to the plan most of the time is more important than strict perfection every day.
--    Track Progress: Monitor your weight, strength gains, and body composition. If you're not gaining weight after 2-3 weeks, gradually increase your calories (e.g., by 200-300 kcal/day).
--    Strength Training: This diet plan is optimized for muscle gain, but it must be paired with a consistent and progressive strength training program.
--    Rest and Recovery: Allow your muscles adequate time to recover and grow. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.
-- •   Professional Guidance: For highly personalized advice and to address any specific health concerns, consult with a registered dietitian or a certified sports nutritionist.

-- Good luck on your muscle gain journey, Alex!

-- ---
-- 
-- 4. Meal Prep Tips
-- 
--    Batch Cook Grains: Cook a large batch of brown rice, quinoa, or lentils at the beginning of the week. Store in airtight containers in the fridge for quick meal assembly.
--    Pre-chop Vegetables: Wash and chop vegetables like bell peppers, onions, broccoli, and carrots in advance. Store them in the fridge, ready to be added to stir-fries, curries, or salads.
--    Prepare Protein Sources:
--        Hard-boil a dozen eggs for quick snacks.
--        Bake or pan-fry a large block of tofu or tempeh, then slice and store.
--        Make a big batch of chickpea or lentil curry/stew.
--    Smoothie Packs: Portion out fruits, spinach, and seeds into individual bags or containers and freeze. In the morning, just add protein powder, liquid, and blend.
--    Overnight Oats: Prepare overnight oats the night before for a grab-and-go breakfast.
--    Healthy Snacks on Hand: Keep nuts, seeds, fruit, and Greek yogurt readily available to avoid less healthy choices.
-- 
-- ---
-- 
-- 5. Hydration Recommendations
-- 
--    Target: Aim for at least 3-4 liters (100-140 oz) of water per day. Given your activity level and goal of muscle gain (which increases metabolic processes and protein intake), sufficient hydration is critical.
--    Consistency: Sip water throughout the day, rather than drinking large amounts at once.
--    Before/During/After Workouts: Increase water intake around your workout times.
--    Monitor Urine Color: A pale yellow color indicates good hydration. Darker urine suggests you need more water.
--    Limit Sugary Drinks: Avoid sodas, energy drinks, and excessive fruit juices, as they contribute empty calories and can hinder your progress. Herbal teas and infused water are good alternatives.
-- 
-- ---
-- 
-- 6. Supplement Recommendations (Optional, but beneficial for muscle gain)
-- 
-- While whole foods should always be the foundation, certain supplements can help meet your needs for muscle growth and recovery.
-- 
-- 1.  Vegetarian Protein Powder (Whey or Plant-Based Blend):
--        Benefit: Convenient way to increase protein intake, especially around workouts, to support muscle protein synthesis.
--        Recommendation: A high-quality Whey Protein Isolate (if you consume dairy) or a Plant-Based Protein Blend (pea, rice, hemp, soy) if you prefer to avoid dairy. Aim for 20-30g protein per serving.
--        Timing: Post-workout, or as a snack between meals.
-- 2.  Creatine Monohydrate:
--        Benefit: The most researched and effective supplement for increasing strength, power output, and lean muscle mass.
--        Recommendation: 3-5g daily, consistently. It doesn't need to be cycled.
--        Timing: Any time of day, as consistency is key. Can be mixed with your protein shake or water.
-- 3.  Multivitamin/Mineral:
--        Benefit: Acts as an "insurance policy" to ensure you're getting all essential micronutrients, which can sometimes be tricky with a focused diet.
--        Recommendation: A reputable brand's daily multivitamin.
--        Timing: With a meal to enhance absorption.
-- 4.  Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Algae-based):
--        Benefit: Essential for heart health, brain function, reducing inflammation, and overall well-being. Vegetarian diets can sometimes be lower in EPA/DHA.
--        Recommendation: An algae-based DHA/EPA supplement is suitable for vegetarians.
--        Timing: With a meal.
-- 5.  Vitamin D3:
--        Benefit: Crucial for bone health, immune function, and can play a role in hormone regulation, including testosterone. Many people are deficient.
--        Recommendation: 1000-2000 IU daily, especially if you have limited sun exposure.
--        Timing: With a meal containing fats for better absorption.

-- 
-- 7. Foods to Avoid and Prioritize
-- 
-- Foods to Prioritize:
-- 
--    High-Quality Vegetarian Protein:
--        Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans, edamame.
--        Soy Products: Tofu, tempeh, edamame, soy milk.
--        Dairy (if consumed): Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, paneer, milk, cheese.
--        Eggs (if consumed): Whole eggs.
--        Nuts & Seeds: Almonds, walnuts, cashews, peanuts, chia seeds, flax seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, nut butters.
--        Whole Grains (minor protein contribution): Quinoa, oats, brown rice, whole wheat bread/pasta.
--    Complex Carbohydrates:
--        Whole Grains: Brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, barley, farro.
--        Starchy Vegetables: Sweet potatoes, potatoes, corn, peas.
--        Fruits: Berries, bananas, apples, oranges, pears, mangoes.
--    Healthy Fats:
--        Avocado, olive oil, nuts, seeds, nut butters.
--    Vitamins & Minerals:
--        A wide variety of colorful fruits and vegetables (leafy greens, bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, berries, citrus fruits).
-- 
-- Foods to Avoid/Limit:
-- 
--    Highly Processed Foods: Packaged snacks, fast food, processed vegetarian meats high in sodium and unhealthy fats. These often lack nutrients and are high in empty calories.
--    Excessive Added Sugars: Candies, sugary drinks (soda, sweetened juices, energy drinks), most desserts. These provide quick energy but lead to crashes and minimal nutritional benefit.
--    Trans Fats: Found in some processed foods, fried foods, and baked goods. Look for "partially hydrogenated oil" on ingredient lists.
--    Refined Grains (as primary carb source): White bread, white pasta, white rice (while not necessarily "bad" in moderation, prioritize whole-grain versions for more fiber and nutrients).
--    Excessive Saturated Fats: While some saturated fat is okay, excessive amounts from cheese, butter, and fried foods should be moderated.
-- 
-- ---
-- 
-- Important Considerations:
-- 
--    Consistency is Key: Stick to the plan as much as possible, but don't be afraid to make minor adjustments based on your preferences and what's available.
--    Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to your hunger and satiety cues. If you're consistently very hungry, you might need a bit more food; if you're feeling overly full, slightly reduce portions.
--    Track Progress: Monitor your weight, strength gains, and how your clothes fit. If you're not gaining weight (0.5-1 lb per week is a good target for lean muscle gain), consider increasing your daily calorie intake by 200-300 kcal.
--    Workout Synergy: This diet plan is designed to support a consistent strength training program. Without effective resistance training, muscle gain will be minimal regardless of diet.
--    Consult a Professional: For personalized adjustments or if you have any health concerns, consider consulting a registered dietitian or a sports nutritionist.

-- 4. Meal Prep Tips for Success
-- 
-- Meeting high calorie and protein goals as a vegetarian requires consistent effort. Meal prepping can significantly help:
-- 
-- 1.  Batch Cook Grains: Cook large quantities of brown rice, quinoa, couscous, or bulgur at the beginning of the week. Store in airtight containers.
-- 2.  Prep Legumes: Cook dried lentils, chickpeas, or beans in bulk, or stock up on canned varieties. Rinse and store for quick additions to meals.
-- 3.  Chop Veggies: Wash and chop all your vegetables for stir-fries, salads, and curries at the start of the week.
-- 4.  Cook Protein Sources: Bake or pan-fry a large batch of tofu or tempeh, or make a big pot of lentil/bean chili that can be portioned out for several meals.
-- 5.  Assemble Smoothie Packs: Portion out frozen fruits, spinach, and seeds into individual bags. In the morning, just add protein powder and liquid to a blender.
-- 6.  Pre-Portion Snacks: Measure out nuts, seeds, and dried fruit into individual containers or bags for easy grab-and-go options.
-- 7.  Make Sauces/Dressings: Prepare your stir-fry sauces, salad dressings, or hummus in advance.
-- 8.  Utilize Leftovers: Cook extra dinner servings to use as lunch the next day.

-- 5. Hydration Recommendations
-- 
-- Staying well-hydrated is crucial for overall health, athletic performance, and nutrient transport.
-- 
--    Water Intake: Aim for at least 3-4 liters (12-16 glasses) of water per day. This amount will increase on days you are more active or if you consume more caffeine.
--    During Workouts: Sip water consistently during your workouts.
--    Before/After Meals: Drink a glass of water before each meal to aid digestion and help with satiety.
--    Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to thirst cues and the color of your urine (it should be pale yellow).
--    Include Hydrating Foods: Many fruits and vegetables (cucumber, watermelon, oranges) contribute to your daily fluid intake.
--

-- 
-- 6. Supplement Recommendations
-- 
-- While whole foods should always be the priority, certain supplements can be beneficial for a vegetarian aiming for muscle gain.
-- 
-- 1.  Plant-Based Protein Powder: (Highly Recommended) Essential for easily reaching your high protein target. Look for blends with pea, rice, and hemp protein to ensure a complete amino acid profile.
-- 2.  Creatine Monohydrate: (Highly Recommended) One of the most researched and effective supplements for increasing strength, power, and muscle mass.
--        Dosage: Typically 5g per day, taken at any time. A loading phase (20g/day for 5-7 days) is optional but can speed up saturation.
-- 3.  Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Algae-based): (Recommended for Vegetarians) Since you don't eat fish, an algae-based Omega-3 supplement (providing EPA and DHA) is crucial for heart health, brain function, and reducing inflammation.
-- 4.  Vitamin B12: (Highly Recommended for Vegetarians) Found almost exclusively in animal products, B12 supplementation is vital for vegetarians to prevent deficiency, which can cause fatigue and nerve damage.
--        Dosage: Often 250-1000mcg per day.
-- 5.  Vitamin D3: (Potentially Recommended) Many people are deficient, regardless of diet. Important for bone health, immune function, and potentially muscle function.
--        Dosage: Typically 2000-5000 IU daily, especially if you have limited sun exposure. Consult with a doctor for testing.
-- 6.  Multivitamin/Mineral: (Optional, as a 'safety net') A good quality multivitamin can help cover any micronutrient gaps, especially when transitioning to a new diet or in times of high physical stress.
-- 
-- Always consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian before starting any new supplement regimen.

-- 
-- 7. Foods to Avoid and Prioritize
-- 
-- Foods to Prioritize:
-- 
--    High-Quality Protein Sources: Tofu, tempeh, edamame, lentils, chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans, seitan, paneer, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, nutritional yeast, quinoa, plant-based protein powders.
--    Complex Carbohydrates: Whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole-wheat bread/pasta, sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, corn, whole fruits, starchy vegetables.
--    Healthy Fats: Avocados, nuts (almonds, walnuts, cashews), seeds (chia, flax, hemp, pumpkin), olive oil, nut butters.
--    Plenty of Vegetables: A wide variety of colorful vegetables for vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Don't be shy with greens!
--    Fruits: Berries, bananas, apples, oranges, and other fruits for natural sugars, vitamins, and antioxidants.
-- 
-- Foods to Minimize or Avoid:
-- 
--    Highly Processed Foods: White bread, sugary cereals, frozen dinners, packaged snacks that are high in unhealthy fats, sugar, and sodium.
--    Sugary Drinks: Sodas, fruit juices with added sugar, energy drinks. These provide empty calories and can hinder muscle gain and overall health.
--    Excessive Fried Foods: Foods deep-fried in unhealthy oils add a lot of empty calories and unhealthy fats.
--    Refined Grains: While not strictly "bad," they offer less nutritional value than whole grains. Prioritize whole grains whenever possible.
--    Trans Fats: Found in some processed foods, baked goods, and fried items. Always check labels for "partially hydrogenated oil."
-- 
-- ---
-- 
-- Important Considerations:
-- 
--    Listen to Your Body: This plan is a template. Adjust portion sizes slightly based on your hunger levels and how you feel. If you're consistently very hungry, increase portion sizes of complex carbs and healthy fats.
--    Consistency is Key: Muscle gain is a slow process that requires consistent effort in both training and nutrition. Stick with the plan as much as possible.
--    Training: This diet plan is designed to support a resistance training program. Ensure you're lifting weights regularly (3-5 times a week) with progressive overload to stimulate muscle growth.
--    Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night, as this is when much of muscle repair and growth occurs.
-- •   Flexibility: Don't aim for perfection every day. If you deviate from the plan, just get back on track with the next meal.
-- 
-- Good luck with your muscle gain journey!
