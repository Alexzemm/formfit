-- * **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day and during your workout.
-- * **Nutrition:**  Support your muscle gain with a balanced diet that provides sufficient protein.
-- * **Modifications:** If an exercise is too difficult, modify it.  For example, use lighter weights, do fewer reps, or choose an easier variation.  If you are new to exercise, start with only 2-3 days a week to avoid overtraining.
